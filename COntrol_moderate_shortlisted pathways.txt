	Negative Regulation Of Axonogenesis (GO:0050771)
	Negative regulation of axonogenesis refers to processes that inhibit or restrict the growth and development of axons in neurons. Axons are the long, slender projections of nerve cells that transmit electrical signals to other neurons, muscles, or target cells. In the context of Alzheimer's disease, negative regulation of axonogenesis can be particularly relevant, as axonopathy (damage to axons) is a key feature of the disease.
Amyloid-beta (Aβ) Plaques: Alzheimer's disease is characterized by the accumulation of amyloid-beta plaques in the brain. These plaques can disrupt axonal transport and cause axon degeneration. This can be seen as a negative regulation of axonogenesis since the axons are prevented from growing or maintaining their health.
	

	

Excitatory Chemical Synaptic Transmission (GO:0098976)
	Excitatory chemicals, particularly glutamate, play a crucial role in normal brain function, as they are the primary neurotransmitters responsible for transmitting signals between neurons. However, an excessive release of excitatory neurotransmitters, such as glutamate, can lead to a condition known as excitotoxicity. This overstimulation of neurons can cause damage and cell death, which is a significant concern in neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease.
	

	Negative Regulation Of Protein Kinase Activity (GO:0006469)
	Any process that stops, prevents, or reduces the frequency, rate or extent of kinase activity, the catalysis of the transfer of a phosphate group, usually from ATP, to a substrate molecule. This regulation is a fundamental aspect of cellular signaling pathways, including those implicated in Alzheimer's disease.
In Alzheimer's disease, abnormal protein phosphorylation and kinase activity are known to be involved in the pathogenesis of the disease.
	

	Regulation Of Neuron Projection Development (GO:0010975)
	Neuron projections are cellular processes that extend from neurons and include axons and dendrites. Neuron projection development is a critical process in the formation and functioning of the nervous system. In the context of neurological diseases and conditions, the regulation of neuron projection development is of significant interest. Disruptions in neuron projection development can lead to various neurological disorders, including neurodevelopmental disorders, neurodegenerative diseases, and even psychiatric conditions.
	

	Anterograde Trans-Synaptic Signaling (GO:0098916)
	"Anterograde" means the transmission of signals from the presynaptic neuron (the neuron sending the signal) to the postsynaptic neuron (the neuron receiving the signal) in a forward or downstream direction. This process is essential for normal neuronal communication and plays a critical role in various functions of the nervous system, including learning, memory, and motor control. Dysfunction in anterograde trans-synaptic signaling can lead to a range of neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders.

	Cocaine addiction
	Cocaine addiction can have significant neurobiological effects, particularly in areas of the brain associated with reward and pleasure. While this is distinct from Alzheimer's disease, it is essential to understand how substances like cocaine can influence brain function. Chronic cocaine use can trigger neuroinflammation, which is the brain's response to damage or injury.

	Amphetamine addiction
	Amphetamine addiction is a pathway associated with addiction to amphetamine-based drugs, such as methamphetamine. It focuses on the molecular and cellular changes that occur in the brain due to amphetamine use, leading to addictive behaviors. Chronic amphetamine use can lead to cognitive impairments and memory problems. While these cognitive issues are distinct from Alzheimer's, understanding the cognitive deficits associated with amphetamine addiction could inform our understanding of the cognitive decline in Alzheimer's.

	Bacterial invasion of epithelial cells
	Bacterial invasion of epithelial cells is a pathway that elucidates how certain pathogenic bacteria can invade and establish infections within the epithelial cells of the host. Bacterial infections trigger immune responses, including the activation of microglia, the brain's resident immune cells. Dysregulated immune responses and the chronic activation of microglia have been implicated in Alzheimer's pathology.
